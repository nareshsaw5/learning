# If you need diff between two JSON content without worrying about its order, this library helps you do find the diff. The library does not implement any RFC, however uses Open Source library [zjsonpatch] (https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/zjsonpatch) extensively and has been enhanced to be used below use-case. The library is written in Java.

## Description & Use-Cases
- It is a Java Library to find differences between two JSON content.
- zjsonpatch has implemented [RFC 6902](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).
- The zjsonpatch adhere RFC and returns these two array as different: left = [1,2,3,4]  vs right = [2,1,4,3]
- Enhancements:
1.  Ignore Array Order:  This library ignore array order to generate array diff. E.g. [1,2,3,4,5] equals to [2,1,3,5,4]  and ["Bob","Mary"] equals to ["Mary", "Bob"]
1. Compare array elements with businessKey as identifier:
 E.g. In below
 arrays(left and right), Bob is compared against John as they have same businessKey 
 
 left =[{"name":"Bob","businessKey":"4444"},{"name":"John","businessKey":"5555"}]
 
 right = [{"name":"Bob","businessKey":"6666"},{"name":"John", "businessKey":"4444"}]

### Compatible with : Java 8 onwards versions

### How to use:

Add following to `<dependencies/>` section of your pom.xml -

```xml
<groupId>com.cisco.apicem</groupId>
<artifactId>common-dnjson-diff</artifactId>
<version>7.1.260-SNAPSHOT</version>
```


## API Usage

### Obtaining diff list
```xml
List<Diff> diff = new DnjsonDiff().getDiff(String sourceJsonContent, String targetJsonContent)
```

### Example
Left Json
``` 
left =[{"name":"Bob","businessKey":"4444"},{"name":"John","businessKey":"5555"}]
```

Right Json
```
right = [{"name":"Bob","businessKey":"6666"},{"name":"John", "businessKey":"4444"}]
```
Following diff will be returned:
```json
[
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "configuredValue": "John",
        "intendedValue": "Bob",
        "moveFromPath": null,
        "businessKey": "4444",
        "path": "/0/name",
        "extendedAttributes": null,
        "displayName": null
    },
    {
        "op": "remove",
        "configuredValue": null,
        "intendedValue": "{\"name\":\"John\",\"businessKey\":\"5555\"}",
        "moveFromPath": null,
        "businessKey": "5555",
        "path": "/1",
        "extendedAttributes": null,
        "displayName": null
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "configuredValue": "{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"businessKey\":\"6666\"}",
        "intendedValue": null,
        "moveFromPath": null,
        "businessKey": "null",
        "path": "/0",
        "extendedAttributes": null,
        "displayName": null
    }
]
```
